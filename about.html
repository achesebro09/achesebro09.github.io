        <section class="about">
            <p>Established in 2020 after deciding on a whim to make a dream catcher as a gift for a friend, I fell in love with the repetitive motion of weaving the string for the heart. Decorating them with different mediums was interesting in the beginning but using dried flowers is my favorite. I do research on the flowers used in each piece to prevent damaged petals from over drying or discoloration from not drying enough by pulling them too soon.<br>
            I take care in preparing my mice and rats for the taxidermy process. I treat all of the animals with respect through the whole preparation of the body to completion.</p>
